            <h3>GetWeather App</h3>
            <img src="./images/GetWeather App.png" alt="Screenshot of the project">
            <p>Designed, created, and build a GetWeather React.js app that lets you find the weather of any city and give you all the
              relevant weather information in an interactive & responsive UI.
              To built the the App I used the create-react-app as base for the app changed the App.js and index.js files with 
              my own and also changed the App.css and added 3 more components. Used latest Bootstrap for responsiveness where 
              the grid system and flexbox(both used) came handy as well as the CSS3 media queries helped in positioning the 
              content at different screen sizes. Moment.js is another handy tool used for date & time manipulation.
              <br>Following are the tools/lib/frameworks used-<br>  
              1.React.js 
              2.Moment.js 
              3.Bootstrap 4.5.2 
              4.JavaScript(ES6+) 
              5.CSS3 
              6.HTML5
              7.Webpack
              8.Babel.js<br>
              <strong>Future scope-</strong> To use Google maps to get the local timezone, precipitation
              prediction, and some more information in improved UX where users can select what they want to know.</p>

            <h3>Youtube-clone</h3>
            <img src="./images/youtube-clone.png" alt="Screenshot of the project" >
            <p>This is a react web app which is technically a clone of the youtube. It has almost all the functionality of the youtube. 
              This project demonstrates the power of React and react-roter. It is styled using Flexbox which handles the responsiveness 
              and positioning of each of the components and Material-UI is used for getting the flat looking style that the original youtube has. 
              This is hoisted using Firebase. <br>
              
              <br><strong>Tech Stack</strong> ---- React, React-router, Firebase, Material-UI, Flexbox, CSS3, HTML5 is 
              used and also all the classnames used <strong>BEM_convention</strong> it is completely responsive also.<br>
              <strong>Future Scope</strong> -- Next I am planning to add user authentication feature using Firebase. 
              Search page will be routed to some of the relevant pages and the ability to route to relevant videos will also be upgraded</p>

            <h3>Color-Guessing-Game</h3>
            <img src="./images/Color-guessing-game.png" alt="Screenshot of the project" >
            <p>A JavaScript color guessing game. This is a guessing game built with JavaScript where users have to guess the correct color 
              from a color palette which matches to the RGB() color code displayed. It has two modes EASY and HARD choose which ever you want. 
              The EASY mode consists of 3 boxes so the probability is high in choosing the correct color. The HARD will have 6 boxes and 
              hence the probability is less in choosing the correct color.<br>
              <strong>Tech Stack</strong> ---- JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 is used and it is responsive also.<br>
              <strong>Future Scope</strong> -- Next I am planning to upgrade to difficult levels and add a database to show case the scores. 
              Also a score-keeper app will be added with this app to monitor the progress along with authentication to track users.</p>
